 I am currently a Lecturer of Mathematics at Towson University. 

My research background is in algebraic geometry. In particular, I focus on polynomial interpolation type problems. 

I received my PhD in Mathematics in 2024 at Pennsylvania State University under [Jack Huizenga](https://sites.psu.edu/jhuizenga/) and John Lesieutre. I received my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics in 2019 at The College of New Jersey under [Steffen Marcus](https://owd.tcnj.edu/~marcuss/).
